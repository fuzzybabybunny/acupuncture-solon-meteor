          <p>Ms. Zhengping Chen graduated from <a href="http://www.southbaylo.edu" target="_blank">South Baylo University</a> in Anaheim, CA at the top of her class and obtained a Master of Science degree in Acupuncture &amp; Oriental Medicine after its four-year full-time postgraduate program which included 3,000 hours of training. After graduation, she received intensive advanced training at China's most reputable Chinese medical school, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Chinese_Medicine" target="_blank">Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine</a>, in Beijing, China.</p>
          <p>Ms. Zhengping Chen comes from a family of traditional Chinese medical doctors. She is a third-generation oriental medicine doctor and started learning acupuncture and herbal medicine when she was a teenager in China. Because of her deep roots in oriental medicine, she is skilled in techniques most Western-educated oriental medicine doctors are unaware of. She has worked with her mother and sister in Seattle, where her family owns a successful oriental medicine clinic, and is also skilled in herbal health care.</p>
